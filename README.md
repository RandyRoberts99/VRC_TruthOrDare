# VRC_TruthOrDare
This is a basic script for running a game of Truth or Dare with automated questions in VRChat.
In order to install this script into a VRChat world, you'll need to have UdonSharp 1.0, which can be found here: https://github.com/vrchat-community/UdonSharp

# Things to note:
This script as well as the two helper scripts accompanied will require you to have your own gameobjects. You'll need one Trigger for the game area, two Triggers for the buttons (Truth/Dare) and a Text Mesh Pro UGUI for the text. Udon Scripts allow you to assign GameObjects as references for the scripts to run. This makes for easy plug and play once you have the necessary objects in your scene.
